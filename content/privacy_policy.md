rely on next to each purpose listed below.

We use the information we collect or receive:

- **To facilitate account creation and logon process**. If you choose to link

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use
such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
[Cookie Notice](cookie_notice.html).

### How long do we keep your information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period
is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account
with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
possible.

### How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise
or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect,
access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to
and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website
within a secure environment.

### What are your privacy rights?

In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights
under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details
provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you
have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that
this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal,
nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to
complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find
their contact details here:

account or terminate your account, you can:

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete
your account and information from our active databases. However, we may
retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with
applicable legal requirements.

**Cookies and similar technologies**: Most Web browsers are set to accept
cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser
to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or
reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Website.

### Controls for Do-Not-Track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

### Do California residents have specific privacy rights?

marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with

year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information

_Verification process_

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine
you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.
These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so
that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided
to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will
avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information
already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or
fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
information as soon as we finish verifying you.
